## Storyteller. Programmer. Designer. Knowledge Sponge.

That's me in a nutshell. Hello, I'm Emilia ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about crafting immersive, engaging storytelling and gameplay experiences.


I've been fascinated by stories and storytelling since I was a child and have been playing video games since I was 9.
I spent my time working on my skills as a game developer, playing games, reading and writing stories.
